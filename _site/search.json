    "text": "How you would simulate one realisation from a homogeneous Poisson process on the one dimensional interval \\([t_\\text{min}, t_{max}]\\)?\nDescribe how you would simulate one realisation from a Poisson process in one dimension with a quartic polynomial intensity function over the interval \\([t_\\text{min}, t_{max}]\\) by:\n\n\ngenerating inter-arrival times;\nrejection sampling;\nusing a piecewise constant approximation of \\(\\lambda(t)\\).\n\n\nWhat other methods might you use?\n\n\nCan you write pseudo-code for each of the approaches in question 2? Have you written R or Python code for any/all of the approaches in question 2?\nSuppose you have observed the point pattern \\((x_1,...,x_n)\\) on the interval \\([x_\\text{min}, x_{max}]\\) and you wish to model the intensity function \\(\\lambda(x)\\) as a polynomial function. Write down the likelihood and log-likelihood of the observed point pattern when modelling the intensity using a cubic polynomial.\nHow would your answer to 4 change if you instead modelled \\(\\lambda(t)\\) as a quadratic polynomial?\nHow could you test whether a cubic term improves the fit of your model?\nGenerate a point pattern with a cubic intensity function. Find point estimates and confidence intervals for the polynomial coefficients.\nHow might you visually represent the uncertainty in your estimated intensity function?\nHow could you measure whether a point pattern is more or less clustered than a Poisson process?\nHow could you test whether a point pattern is Poisson, more clustered or more regular?"
